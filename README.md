# Team Vanquish - Epsilon Project 2

For this project, our team collaborated to make an experience cloud customer user site to represent our business of Jojo's Pizza.

We utilized Aura components, apex controllers, javascript controllers, and custom events to create our unique customer cloud experience site. The site has features such as a dynamic pizza builder, application cards, quick buy options, and account pages for the user.

We made this site while working at Revature in order to get acclimated to working with Aura components, and how they connect to salesforce orgs.
